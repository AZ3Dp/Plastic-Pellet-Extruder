The goal of this project is to create a plastic pellet extruder for a 3D printer. The most difficult part is finding proper plastic extrusion components - specifically the auger bit and the heatsink/heatbreak. Since I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a custom metal machined part, I will need to order parts from sellers already making the part.

I've narrowed it down to two options (well, they were the _only_ two options). Both seem promising and potent to work with, but only the Amazon seller will give the drawings for me to recreate in CAD.
I'm not super sure which one to pick.

I am currently completing the CAD for the hardware of the pellet extruder. I am recreating the hardware parts in CAD, so then I can design my extruder around those parts. This process is a bit challenging because I need to look at data sheets and technical drawings, and then find the best way to recreate the model in CAD. I think it looks decent!
