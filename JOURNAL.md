## 10/19/2025 - Brainstorm and Product Research

(Polisi3D Pellet Extruder Component from Amazon)

The goal of this project is to create a plastic pellet extruder for a 3D printer. The most difficult part is finding proper plastic extrusion components - specifically the auger bit and the heatsink/heatbreak. Since I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a custom metal machined part, I will need to order parts from sellers already making the part.

I've narrowed it down to two options (well, they were the _only_ two options). Both seem promising and potent to work with, but only the Amazon seller will give the drawings for me to recreate in CAD.
I'm not super sure which one to pick.


  

## 10/22/2025 8 AM - CAD of Hardware

I am currently completing the CAD for the hardware of the pellet extruder. I am recreating the hardware parts in CAD, so then I can design my extruder around those parts. This process is a bit challenging because I need to look at data sheets and technical drawings, and then find the best way to recreate the model in CAD. I think it looks decent!
  

## 10/22/2025 11 AM - I made a Variable Depth Plastic Screw!  

![Screenshot 2025-10-22 at 11.19.46 AM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDQzNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--20fc18adf9506a64fec8b52395c26969e9389be5/Screenshot%202025-10-22%20at%2011.19.46%E2%80%AFAM.png)
I wanted to create a 3D model of a variable depth plastic screw for my Pellet Extruder. Prior to this, I was simply using an 8mm cylinder as a "placeholder" for the actual part. However, I wanted to expand my CAD skills and make the real thing. So, after a lot of brainstorming on how to make the coil "variable-depth" (meaning the inner diameter of the screw changes, goes from small to large), I used a cone shaped cut (revolution) and used Fusion's "coil" functionality. In the end, I got a model pretty similar to the manufacturer's model!  

## 10/23/2025 - More CAD and Components  

![Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 9.41.52 AM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDc1NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--69311817e9377ff2c0929fc91d63826e7c534072/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20at%209.41.52%E2%80%AFAM.png)
In this work session, I added more components to the CAD model, including:

- brass standoffs
- 5015 fans
- 4010 fans
Note: the fans, I decided, to use generic Prusa i3 Mk3s fan hardware, since it is easily accessible
- started modeling structural 3D printed components
