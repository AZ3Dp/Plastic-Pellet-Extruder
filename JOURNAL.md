The goal of this project is to create a plastic pellet extruder for a 3D printer. The most difficult part is finding proper plastic extrusion components - specifically the auger bit and the heatsink/heatbreak. Since I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a custom metal machined part, I will need to order parts from sellers already making the part.

I've narrowed it down to two options (well, they were the _only_ two options). Both seem promising and potent to work with, but only the Amazon seller will give the drawings for me to recreate in CAD.
I'm not super sure which one to pick.


  

## 10/22/2025 8 AM - CAD of Hardware

I am currently completing the CAD for the hardware of the pellet extruder. I am recreating the hardware parts in CAD, so then I can design my extruder around those parts. This process is a bit challenging because I need to look at data sheets and technical drawings, and then find the best way to recreate the model in CAD. I think it looks decent!
  

## 10/22/2025 11 AM - I made a Variable Depth Plastic Screw!  

![Screenshot 2025-10-22 at 11.19.46 AM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDQzNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--20fc18adf9506a64fec8b52395c26969e9389be5/Screenshot%202025-10-22%20at%2011.19.46%E2%80%AFAM.png)
I wanted to create a 3D model of a variable depth plastic screw for my Pellet Extruder. Prior to this, I was simply using an 8mm cylinder as a "placeholder" for the actual part. However, I wanted to expand my CAD skills and make the real thing. So, after a lot of brainstorming on how to make the coil "variable-depth" (meaning the inner diameter of the screw changes, goes from small to large), I used a cone shaped cut (revolution) and used Fusion's "coil" functionality. In the end, I got a model pretty similar to the manufacturer's model!  

## 10/23/2025 - More CAD and Components  

![Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 9.41.52 AM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDc1NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--69311817e9377ff2c0929fc91d63826e7c534072/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20at%209.41.52%E2%80%AFAM.png)
In this work session, I added more components to the CAD model, including:

- brass standoffs
- 5015 fans
- 4010 fans
Note: the fans, I decided, to use generic Prusa i3 Mk3s fan hardware, since it is easily accessible
- started modeling structural 3D printed components
- added optional heatsink for nema 17 motor  

## 11/3/2025 - Modified Geometry and Added Plastic pellet intake  

![Screenshot 2025-11-03 at 12.59.47 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODEyMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f239b03bd2a91e3c671e7bbe38c04a9f0de013a3/Screenshot%202025-11-03%20at%2012.59.47%E2%80%AFPM.png)
Today, I spent some time brainstorming manufacturing - it's really easy to design something in CAD and not realizing that the geometry would be impossible to assemble in real life. Made some cuts and splits. I also created the inlet for the plastic pellets to enter. I'm thinking of using a cpap tube. Don't want to put too much weight on the extruder.  

## 11/4/2025 12 PM - Created Part Fan Duct and Repositioned Fan  

![Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 12.51.47 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODM1MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--63be4637fbaf49bfe288ec66438bdd89b305029a/Screenshot%202025-11-04%20at%2012.51.47%E2%80%AFPM.png)
Today, I repositioned the fan, because after a ton of brainstorming, I realized having the fan stick out at a 45 degree angle would be hard to accomplish & made the extruder extremely bulky (this would mainly affect CoreXY printers). I also created a crude model of the fan duct. This was quite hard to do, and I watched a couple Youtube videos on lofting and sweeping, etc. I ended up with a rather simple duct, which will hopefully get the job done.  

## 11/4/2025 3 PM - Fluid Dynamics Analysis (CFD) on new fan duct!  

![Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 3.22.24 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODM4MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--120a23545824970cd9ab7024ef399f9d0a4b7a0c/Screenshot%202025-11-04%20at%203.22.24%E2%80%AFPM.png)
So I ended up going down a rabbit hole on fluid dynamics and simulations. Turns out, Fusion does not have CFD capabilities, so I ended up using SimScale. Took me a while to learn the software and successfully create a simulation. Looking at the simulation, the duct is not focusing the air and has too much room for the air to slow down, rather than directly hit the nozzle.
  

## 11/6/2025 - Second Fan Duct Iteration  

![Screenshot 2025-11-06 at 2.00.49 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODk0NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2f36ab4a2969ee3ff8c96b9b679ba0f51b99f174/Screenshot%202025-11-06%20at%202.00.49%E2%80%AFPM.png)
Using the analysis from the Simflow simulation, I worked to improve the fan duct's part cooling geometry. So after some research (and facepalms), the part cooling duct should cool the part, not the nozzle. So, I lowered the duct and thus the air is not pointing more towards the part. In addition, I decreased the thickness of the fan duct. This should improve the airflow pressure onto the part. I also used a different strategy to model the part: I used a slot (sketch profile) and a sweep command to create the geometry. I will run a simulation for this part as well.
Side note: Fusion had updated and now there is dark mode!!!
